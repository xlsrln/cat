## Appendix: team points

Example calculation for team points. (similar to the WRC system)

Note that team points is not always the sum of the individual points!

Given this result:

| Pos   | Driver | Individual points | Team          | Rank in team | Counts for team points? | Team points |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| 1     | A   | 25                | Team X        | 1            | Yes                     | 25 |
| 2     | B   | 20                | Team X        | 2            | Yes                     | 20 |
| 3     | C   | 16                | Team X        | 3            | No                      | \- |
| 4     | D   | 13                | W Motorsports | 1            | Yes                     | 16 |

we get the following standings:
