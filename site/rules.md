Example calculation for team points. (similar to the WRC system)

Note that team points is not always the sum of the individual points!

Given this result:

| Pos   | Driver | Individual points | Team          | Rank in team | Counts for team points? | Team points |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| 1     | A   | 20                | Team X        | 1            | Yes                     | 20 |
| 2     | B   | 18                | Team X        | 2            | Yes                     | 18 |
| 3     | C   | 16                | Team X        | 3            | Yes                      | 16 |
| 4     | D   | 14                | Team X        | 4            | No                      |  |
| 4     | E   | 12                |         |             | No                      |  |
| 5     | F   | 11                | W Motorsports | 1            | Yes                     | 14 |
