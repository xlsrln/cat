**G2D Racing**

Perennial competitors, G2D Racing has a mercenary reputation in the paddock despite their humble enthusiast origins, aggressively pursuing and fielding promising drivers.

**Junker Racing**

Junker Racing runs on beer, duct tape, and a unimaginable level of will power. A team of three drunk engineers with no team logistics, no grand strategy, just a desperate sprint from start to finish. Some question why they are still around, but they only question where the muffler went.
