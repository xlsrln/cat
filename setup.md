# recording setup

[home](index.md)

A popular choice for recording videos on windows is OBS: [https://obsproject.com/download](https://obsproject.com/download)

Once it's installed, first add art of rally as an input source by pressing `add source > game capture > art of rally`

If you see anything in the preview, it's all good. Press start recording to record and stop when you're done!

If you are uploading to youtube, you can use the naming format `[CAT 2022] rally sardinia | 12:34 nept 69` but it is by no means mandatory.

## clock overlay (optional)

If you want a realtime clock overlay, you can `add source > browser source` and enter the following text as the URL. If you want another colour or size, you can change where it says "purple" or "30px".

## controller overlay (optional)

Similar to the clock overlay: go to [https://gamepadviewer.com/](https://gamepadviewer.com/) and configure your settings, and add as a browser source. For reference, mine is `https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&s=0&smeter=1&nocurve=1&soffset=40`
