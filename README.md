# Catface Aor Tournament presented by catface rally club


#### Welcome!

This championship is meant to be fun and easy to participate in. I'm trying to automate as much of the paperwork as possible, for instance by having a submission form with a script that will post the standings automatically. This means that there will be no traditional stewarding, but a combination of automation, trust and peer review. If you make an error or spot something suspicious in someone elses submission, please get in touch. If you have any feedback or want to help automate something also don't hesitate to reach out!

All you need to enter is the art of rally game, your favourite screen recording software and a youtube/twitch channel.

Please check the [rules](https://github.com/xlsrln/cat/blob/main/cat_rules.md) and the [setup help](https://github.com/xlsrln/cat/blob/main/setup_help.md)
